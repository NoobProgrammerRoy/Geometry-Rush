# Geometry-Rush
Geometry Rush is a 2D Hyper Casual Endless Runner Game for Android and Web.
Created using the Godot game engine, the game takes inspiration from games such as Flappy Bird and Geometry Dash.
It is my first game created using the Godot game engine, so although the game isn't perfect, it was a great learning experience for me.
Expect Better Games in the future :)
